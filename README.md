# uap-clj

A [`ua-parser/uap-core`](https://github.com/ua-parser/uap-core) based library for extracting browser, operating system, and device information from a raw useragent string:

This library is also used by an Apache Hadoop Hive Simple UDF, [`uap-clj-hiveudf`](https://github.com/russellwhitaker/uap-clj-hiveudf).

## Setup

Add this to the `:dependencies` stanza of your `project.clj`:

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/uap-clj/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/uap-clj)

`uap-clj` depends on the file `regexes.yaml` actively maintained in the public [`ua-parser/uap-core`](https://github.com/ua-parser/uap-core) repository, as well as on the test fixtures `test_ua.yaml`, `test_os.yaml`, and `test_device.yaml` contained therein. Be sure to run `lein deps` after cloning this code repository, and re-run on occasion to pull in changes committed to those `uap-core` assets.

To generate your classes and .jar files:

```bash
lein clean && lein uberjar
```

###Java dependencies

This code has been tested and shown to run under Java v1.7 (Mac OS X v10.9.5):

```bash
â†’ java -version
java version "1.7.0_51"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_51-b13)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.51-b03, mixed mode)
```

## Use

### commandline (CLI)


```bash
/usr/bin/java -jar uap-clj-1.0.0-standalone.jar <input_filename> [<optional_out_filename>]
```

This command takes as its first argument the name of a text file containing one useragent per line, and prints a TSV (tab-separated) file - defaulting to `useragent_lookup.tsv` - with this line format:

`useragent string<tab>browser family<tab>browser major<tab>browser minor<tab>browser patch<tab>os family<tab>os major<tab>os minor<tab>os patch<tab>os patch minor<tab>device family<tab>device brand<tab>device model<newline>`

The output file has a single-line header and can be be trivially imported by your favorite spreadsheet or database ETL tool.

A Leiningen-based run option is available as well, which is particularly convenient during development:

```bash
lein run <input_filename> [<optional_out_filename>]
```

Note that these instructions assume you're using the standalone version of the project .jar file, for development & portability: this will get you running quickly, but it's almost always a better thing to use the mininal jarfile instead, since it _doesn't_ pull in 4Mb of dependencies. To enable this, you'll need to install prerequisite dependencies (specified in `project.clj`) on your classpath.


## Future / Enhancements

I have responded to issues posted to this repository with enhancements I rolled into the codebase, so I do welcome feedback from users. Also, pull requests will be very happily considered.
